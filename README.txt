This application is based on a great JavaFX 8 tutorial by Marco Jakob.
For more information about this, please visit code.makery.ch!
The basis application contains the personal administration and birthday statistics.

More about the altar service version:
ATTENTION! Some parts of this application are GERMAN, because it is already in service at my altar service group!
If it is opaque, please tell me.

For sending mails the configuration is set for 'gmx.net', in further versions it will be modifiable.

Most functions that will be used from the application, will write this in a txt-File (logger.txt),
so that somebody else can read, which functions are used or if an error has been occured.

This application includes the possibility to send mails in different ways:
1) SingleMail: just for a single mail to one receiver.
2) GroupMail: sending a mail to all persons in your administration or to a lot of them.
	The people are divided in five groups (this belongs to our special structure at our rectory!)
3) Remainder-Mails: if the altar service has got a duty roster about all masses,
	it is possible to insert the roster in this application
	and e.g. a week before a mass you could remain the altar service very simple to be there!
	
Like in Remainder-Mails mentioned, it is possible to insert a duty roster of a church community.
This roster will be saved as a xls-file.
